Future Work / Enhancements

While the current system supports student registration and attendance marking via facial recognition, several improvements can make it more robust, scalable, and user-friendly:

Automated Attendance Capture – Integrate live camera feeds in classrooms to automatically detect and mark attendance without manual input, reducing effort and speeding up the process.

Class-wise and Course-wise Organization – Manage students by class, section, or course, and allow teachers to filter and view attendance records for specific groups easily.

Daily & Monthly Dashboards – Provide visual analytics, including daily present/absent ratios, monthly attendance percentages per student, and class summaries, enhancing decision-making for teachers and administrators.

Notifications – Enable SMS or email alerts for low attendance, daily attendance summaries, or missed classes to keep students and parents informed.

Mobile App Integration – Develop a mobile app for teachers to mark attendance on the go, and for students to view their attendance history, utilizing the same cloud APIs for seamless integration.

Security Enhancements – Restrict attendance marking to authorized devices, enforce HTTPS endpoints, and use secure access tokens for API calls to prevent unauthorized access.

Enhanced Facial Recognition – Support multiple faces in a single frame, improve detection for partial or blurred images, and implement anti-spoofing measures to ensure authenticity.

Offline Mode – Allow attendance to be captured offline and synced to the cloud once an internet connection is available, ensuring reliability in low-connectivity areas.

Student Self Check-in (Optional) – Implement kiosks where students can check in themselves using facial recognition, ensuring timely attendance and minimizing proxy marking.

Integration with University ERP – Automatically update attendance in the university’s central system for official records, reports, and performance evaluation.

These enhancements aim to make the system more automated, secure, and aligned with real-world institutional requirements.
